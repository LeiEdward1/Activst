# Activst
This project is a website created in order to help organize and promote protest in the greater New York area. My project team implemented a Leaflet API in order to add a map to our website, to help display potential areas of protests that catered to the users need. The Activst website also utilized Firebase in order to allow users to login with popular social media platforms and store them in Firebase. The website is currently not running, however, a link is provided below for a Google Slide of our presenstation.
